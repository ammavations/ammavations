            Rocket engines are essential to exploration of the final frontier, space.
        </p>
		<p class="cs-flex-p">
			Rocket Engine Development requires careful real time system monitoring, evaluation, and reaction to any condition 
			that arises when combusting powerful propellants to create large amounts of thrust.  We’ve developed a system 
			that’s able operate on hundreds of sensors in a matter of milliseconds using Real Time and FPGA technologies. 
			Data from all these sensors and controls are recorded and stream to multiple operators, who are able to execute 
			sequences remotely and securely with confidence.

            Created burst test equipment to evaluate production quality or drug delivery packets.

		<p class="cs-flex-p">
			Auto injector systems allow life saving treatments to be deployed to users in a matter of seconds in emergency situations.  These auto injectors utilize drug packets that must have the utmost reliability in construction.  Ammavations has developed a production station that test a packets performance in a pressurized condition.  The packet is loaded into the grippers, automatically submersed in water and pressurized until it bursts or bubbles, leaving the operator with insight to the packet’s performance.

            Designed & fabricated infrared camera calibration equipment palletization system

		<p class="cs-flex-p">
			Infrared cameras require a careful calibration routine that runs the sensors through a variety of tests, monitoring 
			the signal data while driving black bodies and cameras to extreme temperatures.  This process can take a long time and 
			when completed on a camera by camera basis, throughput is limited.  Ammavations assisted in developing a palletized 
			system that allows for calibration of up to 64 sensors at one time.  The pallets are a careful balance of automation, 
			strength, and thermal optimization to provide the most repeatable / reliable conditions.
